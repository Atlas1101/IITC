//Null is an object type that represents nothing ie person = null = the value is nothing but person is still an object

//21 let has to be declared before use and can be re-declared (but not in the same scope) Var can be re-declared regardless of the scope. Const can not be re=declared no matter the scope.

//22 use type of

//23 105
//24       3<2

//25 primitive data types eg  numbers string booleans undefined cannot be change (?) they are compared by value. Objects are complex and they can hold multiple values such as arrays object literals and functions
